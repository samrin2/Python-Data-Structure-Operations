# Python Data Structure Operations

## Description
This project is a part of my virtual internship in Data Science and Python under Main Flow Service. The goal is to demonstrate the ability to perform fundamental operations on various Python data structures, including lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.

## Data Structures Covered
- **Lists**: Ordered, mutable collections of items.
- **Tuples**: Ordered, immutable collections of items.
- **Dictionaries**: Unordered, mutable collections of key-value pairs.
- **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique items.

## Operations Demonstrated
### Lists
- Creating a list
- Adding an element to a list
- Removing an element from a list
- Modifying an element in a list

### Tuples
- Creating a tuple
- Accessing elements in a tuple

### Dictionaries
- Creating a dictionary
- Adding a key-value pair to a dictionary
- Removing a key-value pair from a dictionary
- Modifying a value in a dictionary

### Sets
- Creating a set
- Adding an element to a set
- Removing an element from a set

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samrin1/python-data-structure-operations.git
